# A Kernel-based Test of Independence for Cluster-correlated Data

We introduce a kernel-based independence test, **HSIC**<sub>cl</sub>, to evaluate the generalized dependence between two multivariate variables based on cluster-correlated data. **HSIC**<sub>cl</sub> is implemented as the `HSIC_cl()` function in R language. In this [README](https://pearl-liu.github.io/HSIC_cl/README.html) file, We introduce the usage of the `HSIC_cl()` function and demonstrate how to replicate the simulation results in our [NeurIPS paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/51be2fed6c55f5aa0c16ff14c140b187-Abstract.html).
